            <p>The Girls in Tech AMPLIFY is a ‘must-attend’ startup competition for entrepreneurs, investors, engineers, and designers that explores up and coming trends in innovation, technology, and most importantly, showcases the best and brightest female tech entrepreneurs from the region. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In this special edition of AMPLFY, Girls in Tech Paris will be collaborating with motors for the France-Singapore Year of Innovation to produce an edition geared towards intensification of the collaboration in innovation between France and Singapore.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this competition, female entrepreneurs will pitch their early-stage technology startup on stage to a panel of seasoned venture capitalists and high tech execs to be judged based on the innovativeness and viability of the product or service. Winners will receive attractive prizes along with additional resources such as exclusive networking and coaching opportunities to move their startup forward.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Girls in Tech (GIT) is a global non-profit focused on the engagement, education and empowerment of girls and women who are passionate about technology. Adriana Gascoigne founded GIT in 2007 to create a support framework to help women advance their careers in STEM fields.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Today, GIT aims to accelerate the growth of innovative women entering the high-tech industry and building startups. We achieve this through the creation of proprietary, innovative programming and strategic global partnerships.  With headquarters in San Francisco and more than 100,000 members located around the globe, GIT relies on volunteer efforts to lead each of the 60 local chapters. Programming and events vary by chapter based on local interests and needs. GIT is not just for professional women. We exist for anyone with an interest in technology, startups and providing women with a platform for growth. But we operate with the spirit of the girl within all of us—fearless, lively and determined.</p>

            <br>
            <p>On the occasion of the State Visit by then-French President François Hollande to Singapore in March 2017, Singapore and France agreed to designate 2018 as the Year of Innovation (YOI) in a Joint Declaration on Innovation. Recognising that innovation drives the transformation of our economies and societies, and that both countries have much to learn from each other’s experience, Singapore and France agreed to intensify cooperation in innovation.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="subtitle">YOI 2018 aims to achieve the following objectives:</h3>
            <ul>

                <li> • Foster events and activities held in France and Singapore that could mutually reinforce efforts to attain innovation goals, while focusing on priority sectors where there are substantial opportunities for synergy and partnerships;                    </li>
                <li> • Lay the groundwork for greater bilateral cooperation in innovation beyond the Year of Innovation.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3 class="subtitle">France and Singapore have identified priority sectors in which to showcase innovation, highlight bilateral initiatives and collaboration. The priority sectors include:</h3>
            <ul>
                    <li> • Smart and Sustainable Cities; </li>
                    <li> • Fintech; </li>
                    <li> • Health, Aging and Biotechnologies;</li>
